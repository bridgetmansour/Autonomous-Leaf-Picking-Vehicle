#Autonomous Leaf Picking Vehicle

  Our Project is an autonomous navigation vehicle with mobile arm manipulator 
which has the capability to detect leaves and pick them up. The vehicle begins
at point A and reaches point B using obstacle avoidance. 
  The system uses computer vision to detect and identify potential leaves, 
returning their location. The computer vision program provides accurate
measurements such as the direction of the leaf with respect to the hand
manipulator and the distance of the leaf with respect to the car.
